Short projects to work with Bun - https://bun.sh/

# Installation for Windows
1. Make sure to install Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)
    - pre-req to have WSL activated under your windows system
    - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install
    - I recommend you install windows terminal 
    -- https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/windows-terminal/9N0DX20HK701?hl=en-us&gl=US (pins all your cmd/shell/terminals in one place with tabs)
2. Run the install command inside the WSL shell
    - if you don't know how just basically open a powershell and type "wsl"
3. Recall when in WSL shell "ls", use ls -a to list all files includinghidden ones :)
4. Install Bun and remember to add your path vars so it can run registered on your system!
5. Have Fun :D - Exciting the Future is here!
